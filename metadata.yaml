  description:
    tagline: Create a Managed Instance Group exposed by a HTTP Load Balancer.
    detailed: |-
      Create a virtual machine cluster with a load balancer to make the VMs globally available, and instantaneously manage traffic.
      You can choose whether to deploy your solution through the console directly or download as Terraform on GitHub  to deploy later.
    architecture:
    - The user makes a request to the application deployed on Compute Engine and the request first lands on Cloud Load Balancing.
    - Cloud Load Balancing distributes the traffic to the Compute Engine Managed Instance Group (MIG) which is set up to scale to multiple instances based on traffic growth.
